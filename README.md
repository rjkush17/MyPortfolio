## Running Tests

Page Performance Metrics (Based on Median Run by Speed Index):

First View (Run 3):

Time to First Byte: 0.714 seconds

Start Render: 1.900 seconds

First Contentful Paint: 1.908 seconds

Speed Index: 4.700 seconds

Largest Contentful Paint: 1.908 seconds

Cumulative Layout Shift: 0.002

Total Blocking Time: 0.460 seconds

Page Weight: 1,744KB

These metrics offer insights into the performance of the project during the median run, with a particular focus on the Speed Index, a crucial indicator of how quickly a user perceives the page becoming usable. Here are some additional details to help you understand these metrics:

**Time to First Byte**: This measures how long it took for the first byte of data to be received from the server, indicating the server's responsiveness.

**Start Render**: It represents the time when the browser began rendering content.

**First Contentful Paint**: This metric marks when the first content (e.g., text or images) appeared on the page.

**Speed Index:** The Speed Index is a key indicator of user experience, showing how quickly the page appears to be usable.

**Largest Contentful Paint**: This metric indicates when the largest visible content element on the page finished loading.

**Cumulative Layout Shift**: It measures the extent to which the layout of the page shifts during loading, which can impact user experience.

**Total Blocking Time:** This quantifies how much time the main thread was blocked, which can affect interactivity.

**Page Weight**: This is the total size of all resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) loaded by the page.
